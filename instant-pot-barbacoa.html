                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                <h5>Chipotle Sauce</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add all chipotle sauce ingredients to a food processor or blender, and process until smooth. Set aside.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>Barbacoa</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Trim visible large sections of fat from roast, then cut roast into 6-8 large pieces. Season beef with 1/2 tsp each salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Add vegetable oil to Instant Pot and select "sauté". When hot, add beef and cook for a minute or so on each side, until browned. 
                            Depending on the size of your beef, you may need to do this in batches.</li>
                        <li>Remove browned beef to a plate and add onion. Sauté for 2-3 minutes, until soft.</li>
                        <li>Add in 1 cup beef broth and scrape the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to remove any browned bits. Add in tomato paste, green chiles and bay leaves.</li>
                        <li>Press "Cancel - or Keep Warm/Cancel". Return browned beef to the pot and pour pureed chipotle sauce over the top. Top with both halves of the lime.</li>
                        <li>Close lid securely and make sure the valve is set to "sealing". Select "Manual" or "Pressure Cook" and adjust the +/- button until it reads 60 minutes.</li>
                        <li>When finished cooking, carefully turn the valve to "venting" for a quick pressure release. When the steam has all escaped, and the pin has dropped,
                             remove the lid and discard bay leaves and lime.</li>
                        <li>Remove beef pieces to a large bowl and shred, discarding any purely fat parts.</li>
                        <li>Toss shredded beef with as much of the cooking liquid as you'd like.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <h5>To thicken sauce</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>In a small bowl, stir together 2 Tbsp cornstarch with 3 Tbsp water until smooth. Pour this mixture into the pot with the sauce and select "sauté".</li>
                        <li>Cook for several minutes, stirring often, until thickened to your tastes.</li>
                        <li>Toss shredded beef with as much of the thickened sauce as you'd like.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h5>To crisp edges</h5>
                <p>Line a baking sheet with foil, and preheat broiler to high, adjusting oven rack to the upper third position. Spread shredded beef into an even layer, then broil several minutes. 
                    Stir. Continue broiling and stirring until crisped and charred to your liking.</p>
                <h5>Recommended toppings</h5>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Fresh Cilantro</li>
                        <li>Squeeze of lime juice</li>
                        <li>Cotija cheese (or shredded mexican blend cheese)</li>
                        <li>Quick pickled shallots (mix sliced shallots, juice of a lime, pinch of salt and granulated sugar – let sit in a bowl for 20 minutes)</li>
                        <li>Avocado</li>
                        <li>Queso</li>
                    </ul>
                <h5>Shredding</h5>
                <p>Use a Kitchen Aid mixer with the paddle attachment to shred the beef. Put all beef in the mixing bowl, and run for 5-10 seconds (or until pieces are visibly shredded to your liking). 
                    Faster, cleaner, and more thorough than doing it by hand. Afterwards, comb through the pieces a few times to see if there are any large fat chunks that can be removed. </p>
                <h5>Slow cooker Instructions</h5>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Process sauce ingredients.</li>
                        <li>Sear beef in a skillet on the stove.</li>
                        <li>Add all remaining ingredients to slow cooker, top with seared beef, top with chipotle sauce.</li>
                        <li>Cover and cook on LOW for 8-10 hours, until beef is tender enough to shred easily.</li>
                    </ol>
