                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cut the cucumbers in half lengthwise. Use a teaspoon to scrape out the seeds (start at the far end of the cucumber and scoop towards yourself), 
                            then cut into thin slices. Toss the cucumbers with the salt in a colander. Let drain in the sink for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Soak the red onions in a small bowl of ice water for ten minutes, then drain in a fine mesh strainer. Blot dry with a paper towel.</li>
                        <li>Tap the cucumber-filled colander on the base of the sink to release any excess water. Lay paper towel flat on the counter, 
                            and then dump the cucumbers over top. Use the edges of the towel to blot the cucumbers dry.</li>
                        <li>In a medium bowl, toss the cucumbers, onions, white wine vinegar, olive oil, vegetable oil, sugar, pepper and mint. 
                            Cover and let stand in refrigerator for at least 20 minutes or up to 12 hours.</li>
                        <li>Before serving, taste and adjust seasoning, if necessary. Serve cold.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <h5>Make-ahead</h5>
                <p>This salad can be made up to 12 hours ahead of time. Cover and refrigerate until ready to serve.</p>
                <h5>What type of cucumber to use</h5>
                <p>Use English cucumbers, which are also called seedless, European, burpless, or hothouse cucumbers, as opposed to regular cucumbers. The advantage is that they’re 
                    typically wrapped in plastic instead of waxed to protect the skin and keep moisture in, so you don’t need to peel them. They’re also slightly sweeter with fewer seeds.</p>
