                <h4>Instructions</h4>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Cook and drain pasta according to package directions.</li>
                        <li>then quickly add chicken breasts to the pan, seasoning with 
                            1 teaspoon each of the salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Cook chicken breasts until golden on first side, then flip over. 
                              Cover the pan and reduce heat to medium, cooking until chicken is 
                              no longer pink in the center, about 5 to 7 minutes on the second side. 
                              Place on a plate and cover with foil until cool enough to slice into strips.</li>
                        <li>In a large, deep-sided skillet, melt remaining 1/2 cup butter over medium heat. 
                            Add garlic to pan, cooking until aromatic, about 30 seconds. Reduce heat to medium-low. S
                            eason with remaining salt and pepper.</li>
                        <li>Whisk flour into butter, stirring until no chunks remain. Slowly whisk in cream.</li>
                        <li>Continue to cook just until sauce is steaming and slightly thickened. 
                            Whisk 1/2 cup Parmesan into sauce, stirring until smooth. 
                            Remove pan from heat and cover until ready to serve.</li>
                        <li>To serve, place pasta in a serving bowl or on plates. 
                            Top with sliced chicken and drizzle with sauce. 
                            Garnish with parsley and top with additional Parmesan, if desired.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h4>Notes</h4>
                <h5>Salt the water</h5>
                <p>Always salt your pasta water before cooking to ensure a depth of flavor</p>
                <h5>Cool the noodles</h5>
                <p>When straining cooked pasta, run the noodles under cold water immediately. 
                    Otherwise, the heat from the noodles will cause them to keep cooking 
                    even after they’ve been drained of hot water.</p>
                <h5>Make the sauce low-and-slow</h5>
                <p>When preparing the sauce, pay special attention to the temperature of the stovetop. 
                    For a truly silken sauce, you’ll want to keep the heat low, and cook the sauce slowly.</p>
